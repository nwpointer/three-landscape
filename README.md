# Three landscape

A growing collection of React-three-fiber compatible abstractions for rendering high quality, large scale landscapes scenes. I've been researching how AAA games render terrain and am replicating any browser compatible techniques here.

[<img src="/thumbnail.png">](https://three-landscape.vercel.app/)

Note: this package is not capable of procedurally generating terrain. Height maps and other textures must be authored offline in programs such as [WorldCreator](https://www.world-creator.com/) or generated at run time with custom logic. This is something I'm interested in for its potential to reduce bundle sizes but is out of scope for this module.

### Demo:

https://three-landscape.vercel.app/

Source code for example is available in the /examples/highland@latest directory

### Installation

`npm install three-landscape`

# Documentation

### SplatStandardMaterial

Custom material that extends the meshStandardMaterial with additional properties for splat mapping. Splat mapping makes it possible to render terrains with much higher texture detail while reducing memory usage and bundle size: http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Splat

Can be used in vanilla (non react) Three.js projects by importing from the /three directory `import SplatStandardMaterial from three-lanscape/three`

#### supports:

- all the props & behaviors of meshStandardMaterial
- seamless tile blending (aka texture bombing)
- terrain and detail normal maps
- texture saturation and brightness filters for additional creative control

#### new props:

- splats\*: [Texture] (expects splat data in rgb and a channels)
- normalMaps: [Texture]
- normalWeights: [float]
- diffuseMaps\*: [Texture]
- scale\*: [float] (size of terrain tiles)
- saturation: [float]
- brightness: [float]
- noise\*: Texture

\* required prop

```js
function MySuperCoolTerrain() {
  const [
    displacement,
    normal,
    noise,
    d1,
    n1,
    d2,
    n2,
    d3,
    n3,
    d4,
    splat1,
    splat2,
  ] = useTexture([
    "/hd/heightmap.png",
    "/hd/normalmap.png",
    "/simplex-noise.png",
    "/Assets/Cliffs_02/Rock_DarkCrackyCliffs_col.jpg",
    "/Assets/Cliffs_02/Rock_DarkCrackyCliffs_norm.jpg",
    "/Assets/Rock_04/Rock_sobermanRockWall_col.jpg",
    "/Assets/Rock_04/Rock_sobermanRockWall_norm.jpg",
    "/Assets/Mud_03/Ground_WetBumpyMud_col.jpg",
    "/Assets/Mud_03/Ground_WetBumpyMud_norm.jpg",
    "/Assets/Grass_020/ground_Grass1_col.jpg",
    "/hd/splatmap_00.png",
    "/hd/splatmap_01.png",
  ]);

  const { width, height } = displacement.image;

  return (
    <mesh position={[0, 0, 0]} rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>
      <planeBufferGeometry args={[100, 100, width, height]} />
      <SplatStandardMaterial
        splats={[splat1, splat2]}
        normalMap={normal}
        normalMaps={[n1, n2, n3]} // note there are less normals than diffuse maps - normals are not required for each tile type
        diffuseMaps={[d1, d2, d3, d4, d4, d3]}
        scale={[128 / 4, 128 / 2, 128, 128 * 2, 128, 128, 10]}
        noise={noise}
        displacementMap={displacement}
        displacementScale={10}
        displacementBias={-10}
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

### useProgressiveTexture

Similar to useTexture from [drie](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) but progressively loads higher quality textures over time.

```js
function Terrain(){
    const [quality, textures] = useProgressiveTextures([
      ['/heightmap.png','/normalmap.png'],
      ['/hd/heightmap.png','/hd/normalmap.png']
    ])

    const [displacement, normal] = textures[quality]
    return(
      <mesh>
        <planeBufferGeometry/>
        <meshStandardMaterial color="green" normalMap={normal} displacementMap={displacement} />
      </mesH>
    )
}
```

It is a texture loader that accepts an array of url arrays and returns: Array of texture batches and an int holding the index of the highest quality texture batch that has been downloaded.

All textures in a batch (['/hd/heightmap.png','/hd/normalmap@0.5.png']) are resolved before moving on to the next highest quality level
To get performance benefits, resource batches should be of ordered by ascending quality.

Note: as long as you serve a /basis_transcoder.js and /basis_transcoder.wasm useProgressiveTexture can also auto resolve highly compressed basis textures.
See the BasisTextureLoader and Basisu project for more details: https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal

### Anti terracing hightlmaps
when the mesh density of a terrain is high and height differece exceeds > 255 can look terraced.

this shader averages the the contributions of connected vertex, reducing/removing the terracing effect

###RayleighFog
more realistic implementation of Rayleigh scattering, also known as atmostpheric scattering

###Globe
takes grid of children and wraps geometry arround a sphere of size R

### Mirror grid
creates a grid with repeating, mirrored instances of a child mesh. Usefull for artifitially creating the appearence of infinite terrain from certain viewpoints. Works best with self similar terrains like moutain ranges or sand dunes.

<MirrorGrid>
  <Terrain />
</MirrorGrid>

### vector field material
Like height maps that displace allong the y but allow x,y and z vector values for displacement. Allows for things like overhangs ect.

### MaterialTransition

Animates transitions between materials. This pairs well with useProgressiveTexture allowing you to fade in new textures quality levels as they are resolved.

#### props:

- speed: float seconds
  duration in seconds taken to transition to the next highest quality level.

- mesh: ref
  react ref of the containing mesh

```js
function Terrain(){
    const ref = useRef();
    const [SD, HD] = useProgressiveTextures(
        [t1, t1],
        [t2, t3]
    )
    return (
        <mesh ref={ref}>
            <plane>
            <MaterialTransition mesh={ref} speed={0.4}>
                <splatStandardMaterial {...SD}>
                <splatStandardMaterial {...HD}>
            </MaterialTransition>
        </mesh>
    )
}

```
