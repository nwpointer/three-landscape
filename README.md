# Three landscape

A growing collection of React-three-fiber compatible abstractions for rendering high quality, large scale landscapes scenes. I've been researching how AAA games render terrain and am replicating any browser compatible techniques here.

[<img src="/thumbnail.png">](https://three-landscape.vercel.app/)

Note: this package is not capable of procedurally generating terrain. Height maps and other textures must be authored offline in programs such as [WorldCreator](https://www.world-creator.com/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

### Demo:

https://three-landscape.vercel.app/

Source code for example is available in the /examples/highland@latest directory

### Installation

`npm install three-landscape`

## TerrainMaterial

Custom material that extends the meshStandardMaterial with additional properties for splat mapping. Splat mapping lets you blend and combine multiple surfaces(grass, rocks, sand etc) into one higher resolution material: http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Splat


### Features:

- all the props & behaviors of meshStandardMaterial
- Splatmaps
- Texture saturation and tint
- Stochastic sampling
- Triplanar mapping
- Multiple material blending options

```js
function MySuperCoolTerrain() {
  const textures = useTexture([
    ... list of up to 16* textures
  ]);

  return (
    <mesh>
      <planeBufferGeometry args={[1024, 1024, 1024, 1024]} ref={geometry => {
        if(geometry){
          geometry.attributes.uv2 = geometry.attributes.uv.clone();
          geometry.needsUpdate = true;
        }
      }} />
      <TerrainMaterial
        splats={[textures[1]}
        surfaces={[rock, clif, mud, grass]}
        normalMap={textures[2]}
        displacementMap={textures[3]}
        displacementScale={100.0}
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

### New props:

- splats: Texture[] (expects 4 channel splat data in rgba)
- noise: Texture; used for stochastic sampling
- Surfaces: Surface[];

Most of the new features are configured by modifying surface properties.

### Surfaces:
Surfaces are related groups of textures and properties that define how to render part of the terrain. Rock, grass, sand etc would all be separate surfaces.

example:
```
const grass = {
    diffuse: texture[1],
    normal: texture[2],
    normalStrength: 0.4,
    repeat: 200,
    gridless: true,
    saturation: 0.7,
    tint: new Vector4(0.8,1.0,0.8,1),
};
```

### Blend Modes:
by default all surfaces will be alpha blended based on the weights defined in the provided splatmap(s). This generally looks fine from a distance but you may want to try a different blend mode if the camera is likely to be near the ground. blend mode are a surface specific setting.

##### Noise blending:
uses random noise and splat weights to create a detailed edge. To fully control the shape, you can optionally provide one or more octaves of noise.
```
grass.blend = {
  mode: "noise",
  octaves: {
    blur:0.5,
    amplitude: 1.25,
    wavelength: 1024.0 * 16.0,
    accuracy: 1.25
  }
}
```
To get a better understanding of how each noise parameter effects the edge check out this interactive demo: https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1730-terrain-shader-experiments/noisy-hex-rendering.html

Please see the example directory for advanced usage and example textures.

Note: The textures are not covered by the MIT license and should not be used with out first acquiring the rights to do so.

## useProgressiveTexture

Similar to useTexture from [drie](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) but progressively loads higher quality textures over time.

```js
function Terrain(){
    const [quality, textures] = useProgressiveTextures([
      ['/heightmap.png','/normalmap.png'], // batch 1
      ['/hd/heightmap.png','/hd/normalmap.png'] // batch 2
    ])

    const [displacement, normal] = textures[quality]
    return(
      <mesh>
        <planeBufferGeometry/>
        <meshStandardMaterial 
          color="green" 
          normalMap={normal} 
          displacementMap={displacement} 
        />
      </mesH>
    )
}
```

It is a texture loader that accepts an array of url arrays and returns: Array of texture batches and an int holding the index of the highest quality texture batch that has been downloaded.

All textures in a batch (['/hd/heightmap.png','/hd/normalmap@0.5.png']) are resolved before moving on to the next highest quality level
To get performance benefits, resource batches should be of ordered by ascending quality.

### Basis textures:

Note: as long as you serve provide a /basis_transcoder.js and /basis_transcoder.wasm useProgressiveTexture can also auto resolve highly compressed basis textures.

See the BasisTextureLoader and Basisu project for more details: https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal

## MartiniMesh
Creates a non uniform error minimizing mesh with less geometry than a standard planeBufferGeometry. Acceptable error is measured in world units. Eg error 0 mesh will be nearly identical, a Error 10 mesh will be allowed to differ at most 10 world units at any point from the standard plane. 
```
<mesh>
  <MartiniGeometry displacementMap={displacement} error={10} />
  <meshStandardMaterial color="red" wireframe>
</mesh>
```
