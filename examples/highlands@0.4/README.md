# Three landscape

React-three-fiber compatible abstractions that make it easier to render high quality landscapes scenes.

[<img src="/thumbnail.png">](https://three-landscape.vercel.app/)

This package is not capable of procedurally generating terrain. Heightmaps and other textures must be generated offline in programs such as [WorldCreator](https://www.world-creator.com/) or at run time with custom logic.

## Demo:

## Installation

`npm install three-landscape`

## SplatStandardMaterial

custom material that extends the meshStandardMaterial with additional properties for splat mapping. Splat mapping makes it possible to render large high quality terrains with smaller smaller images.

unlike useProgressive Texture or MaterialTransition spatStandardMaterial can use used in vanilla (non react) Three.js projects.

#### supports:

- all the props & behaviors of meshStandardMaterial
- seamless tile blending (aka texture bombing)
- global & local normals
- modify texture saturation and brightness

#### todo:

- tri-planar projection
- noise based texture blending for sharper transitions
- texture atlas support (sidesteps webgl 16 texture limit per shader & decreases number of files to download)

#### new props:

- splats: [Texture]
- normalMaps: [Texture]
- normalWeights: [float]
- diffuseMaps: [Texture]
- scale: [float]
- saturation: [float]
- brightness: [float]
- noise: Texture

```js
function Terrain() {
  const [displacement, normal, noise, d1, n1, d2, n2, d3, n3, d4, splat1, splat2] = useTexture([
    '/hd/heightmap.png',
    '/hd/normalmap.png',
    '/simplex-noise.png',
    '/Assets/Cliffs_02/Rock_DarkCrackyCliffs_col.jpg',
    '/Assets/Cliffs_02/Rock_DarkCrackyCliffs_norm.jpg',
    '/Assets/Rock_04/Rock_sobermanRockWall_col.jpg',
    '/Assets/Rock_04/Rock_sobermanRockWall_norm.jpg',
    '/Assets/Mud_03/Ground_WetBumpyMud_col.jpg',
    '/Assets/Mud_03/Ground_WetBumpyMud_norm.jpg',
    '/Assets/Grass_020/ground_Grass1_col.jpg',
    '/hd/splatmap_00.png',
    '/hd/splatmap_01.png'
  ])

  const { width, height } = displacement.image

  return (
    <mesh position={[0, 0, 0]} rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>
      <planeBufferGeometry args={[100, 100, width, height]} />
      <SplatStandardMaterial
        normalMap={normal}
        splats={[splat1, splat2]}
        normalMaps={[n1, n2, n3]}
        normalWeights={[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]}
        diffuseMaps={[d1, d2, d3, d4, d4, d3]}
        scale={[128 / 4, 128 / 2, 128, 128 * 2, 128, 128, 10]}
        noise={noise}
        displacementMap={displacement}
        displacementScale={10}
        displacementBias={-10}
      />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

<!-- ## useProgressiveTexture

similar to useTexture from drie but progressively loads higher quality textures over time. Supports basis textures.

```js
function Terrain(){
    const [SD, HD] = useProgressiveTextures(
        [t1, t1],
        [t2,t3]
    )
    ...
}
```

## MaterialTransition

Animates transitions between materials. This pairs well with useProgressiveTexture allowing you to fade in new textures quality levels as they are resolved.

### props:

- speed: float seconds
  duration in seconds taken to transition to the next highest quality level.

- mesh: ref
  react ref of the containing mesh

```js
function Terrain(){
    const ref = useRef();
    const [SD, HD] = useProgressiveTextures(
        [t1, t1],
        [t2, t3]
    )
    return (
        <mesh ref={ref}>
            <plane>
            <MaterialTransition mesh={ref} speed={0.4}>
                <splatStandardMaterial {...SD}>
                <splatStandardMaterial {...HD}>
            </MaterialTransition>
        </mesh>
    )
}

```

## Roadmap:

- useProgressiveTexture:
  similar to useTexture from drie but progressively loads higher quality textures over time. Supports basis textures.

- MaterialTransition:
  Animates transitions between materials. This pairs well with useProgressiveTexture allowing you to fade in new textures quality levels as they are resolved.

- Quadtree based terrain sectors that load based on proximity to the camera or a character controller

- weighted grass / rock dispersal.

- volumetric fog

- custom water and river shaders
