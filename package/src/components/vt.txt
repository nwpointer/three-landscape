- need to render a shader output to a texture / FBO [*]
    -> drei Render texture 

- need to identity what pages, and mips in use
    - for each texel in 1/16th screenspace
        render a page & mip level 
    - use glReadPixels to get list of unique pages
    - update cache and lookup table
        - ideally figure out how to render updates instead of re-rendering every page
    - maintain base level mip so we know there will always be at least one mip level available
    - if visible pages exceeds available memory, replace via LRU
    - update every 4 frames if camera moved

- use vt texture lookup when rendering
